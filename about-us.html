				<h2>About Notational Technologies Incorporate</h2>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
					<p align="justify"><strong class="h3">Our Background</strong><br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify">Notational Technologies is founded out of a realization that  traditional business models in the Engineering Segments are rapidly changing  and become more competitive than earlier due to vast development. The leveraged  pyramid model of  Product development is  tuned to manage cost and efficiency in large projects but it cannot provide the  effective cost, quality and time to market needed by product innovators and  cannot create the environment to attract research oriented and talented  engineers in sense of their true capabilities.</p>
							<p align="justify">IP becoming componentized and most of the product  development companies want to purchase/outsource/co-develop non-core or  &ldquo;adjacent&rdquo; IP. The consulting model of specialty organizations is not flexible  enough to provide proper services to such domain. Specialists also cannot  leverage cross-domain capabilities nor invest in aggregating technologies and  building solutions as these are non-process oriented and follows agile model.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify">Daily new Innovation are coming in markets, in terms of  geography and technology. Product innovators need to be flexible with these new  innovation ecosystems to create new products and to access new ideas. An  engineering partner must facilitate this to achieve quick targets in terms of  Cost, Quality and Time.</p>
							<p align="justify">At Notational Technologies we focus extremely on  engineering, invest proactively in our technology focus areas and have built  the competitive work environment to develop in house products as well to serve  our technology partners. We understand what quality product means, before ship  product in hands of actual customers. Our engineers assures quality in product  in all manners.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify">Our entire organization is having structure where each team work  as small start-up team and each technical member having equal opportunity &amp;  work competency is assign as per experience level due to this we not only ensures  agility but also ensures constant challenge and development for our engineers  and the very best technical minds for our customer&rsquo;s projects.</p>
							<p align="justify">We don&rsquo;t aspire to be everything to everyone and we believe  that to innovate for new markets there is a whole set of ecosystem partners to  work with. We encourage our engineers to work on local and specialized use  cases and get put their hands towards solution. We are also committed to social  impact innovation. The skills and passion developed spill over into all our  activities.</p>
							<p align="justify"><br>
						</p>
						<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
							<p align="justify"><strong class="h3">What We Aspire To</strong></p>
							<p align="justify">We aspire to provide next gen most innovative product &amp;  services: an approach that is about helping our customer&rsquo;s innovations – not  merely offering an offshore, near-shore or onsite set of capabilities but also  involved with them in all respect.<br>
							We seek to explore and engineer new concepts and ideas with  our partners and enhance their products through creativity, fresh approach and  hybrid process specially design to suite project needs.</p>
							<p align="justify">We pride ourselves on our agility to adapt seamlessly to rapidly  changing &amp; challenging market needs, customer requirements &amp;  technological change, and thrive in an environment of constant change to remove  paradox effect.<br>
							We endeavour to work on the most complex and challenging  systems and critical engineering problems and where possible create a  meaningful difference in society by focusing on social innovations.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify">We aim to build local innovation ecosystems to drive success  by not just collaborating with partners, but also nurturing top talent, and  supporting local institutions.<br>
						</p>
						</div>
						<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
						<p align="justify"><span class="h3">Value Proposition</span><br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Requirement Analysis:</strong> Our customers simply describe what  they need. We take these high level problem statements, analyse it statically  and cross check  with customer then functionally  and architecturally elaborate these using a fishbone process. Our team create  hybrid process to fit all needs during this whole process customer has complete  clarity and feedback is taken time to time for making operations smooth.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Value Enhancement:</strong>  We  can drive incremental innovation in areas like implementation, testing,  sustainment and value engineering, and make a significant impact to reduce cost  and improve quality in given time frame. <br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Innovation Next:</strong>  We  understand the Indian ecosystem and we are bound to help our customers conceive  and build products aligned to the needs of emerging markets. We believe that each  markets are unique in product usage, environment, affordability and scale. We  strive to work with niche innovators and ecosystem partners to accelerate  innovation aimed to make social impact..</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Value to Research:</strong>  We  are expanding our R&amp;D facilities to support Innovation Next. We appreciate  that there are always more ideas to explore than there are resources available  but without proper implementation chance of success becomes less so we have  dedicated R&amp;D for Implementation. We work independently on most of concepts  and take them to a decision point. This allows our customers to realize true  values of their ideas.<br>
						</p>
						</div>
						<div class="center wow fadeInDown">
							<p align="justify" class="h3">Technology Vision</p>
							<p align="justify">This is era of more complex and highly specialized product,  they are also becoming more interdependent. While our engineers have very deep  domain knowledge, as a Product based, R&amp;D Company as well as valued service  provider, we can see the opportunities at the intersection of different domains  and in technologies and platforms that can be shared which justify our vision <strong><em>&ldquo;Innovation  with next gen Intelligence&rdquo;</em></strong>.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Truly Technologies Oriented:</strong>   While our investors continue to invest in building the core of their  offerings, there may be significant opportunities in the non-core space to  build related products that can address unmet market needs.<br>
						</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Multi Domain Company:</strong>   There is always an opportunity to leverage technology relevant from one  domain and apply it to another. For example, we have worked on the application  of imaging, video codecs, cloud storage and augmented reality in manufacturing  among other areas of embedded systems. We also work in media and animation  domain. </p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Market Research, Data analytics and Cloud Computing:</strong>  Increasing complexity of systems, pressures  on sustainment cost and availability of information on systems presents a tremendous  opportunity in the area of Market Research and Data Analytics. At Notational  Technologies we have experience in all of these areas and continue to invest in  developing new capabilities.</p>
							<p align="justify"><strong>Open source:</strong>  We are  having lots innovation going on in areas Photo Realistic Animation, Holographic  Operating System, Holographic Processors, Open Source Quick Processor(OSQP), cloud  storage(on fly conversions, data encryption) and tools used in core engineering  product development, We know these open source  architectures will continue to play an  important role in recent time frame. We will continue to invest on our open  source software/ hardware towards realizing assets that accelerate development  of next gen products..</p>
